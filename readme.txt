Before create this project, we have to create our database in SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio.
I have created the database name  'StudentDetails' and table name 'Student' that described below:
ID INT NOT NULL
FirstName Char(50)
LastName Char(50)
Gender Char(10)
Age INT 
After created the table, you can insert some dummies data.

Using entitiyframework, we use DBFirst in this project.
